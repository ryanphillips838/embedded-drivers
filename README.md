# py-drivers
drivers for embedded ICs written in Python

The intent here is to use these with a Raspberry Pi. It might expand at some point to other devices or languages, nothing is set in stone yet and I'm just getting started with this idea.

I am accepting contributions. Thanks to anyone that offers!
